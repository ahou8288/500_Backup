# 500_Backup

The 500 game project is a project to write a computer player for the card game called 500.

In the end a few computer players were written for the game and they were able to play each other and simulate the rules and progress of a game.

To view the code for a player take a look at DumbPlayer, JemmaPlayer or AndrewPlayer.
